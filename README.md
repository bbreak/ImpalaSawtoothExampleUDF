# ImpalaSawtoothExampleUDF
## A simple example of a user-defined string function for Apache Impala.

An exercise in creating a C++ UDF for Impala that takes a string and returns it transformed. There's already a StripVowels function included in the Impala UDF development package, so the purpose of this exercise was simply to write a string UDF of my own.

To do:
* Add some tests. One, at least.
* Document how to build it with the Impala UDF dev package.
* Document what versions of Impala I've tested it with.
* Clean up the CMake setup.
